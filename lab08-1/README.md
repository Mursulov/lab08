## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lab08
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have CMake and a C++ compiler installed on your system. For Linux, you can install the necessary packages using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   Create a build directory and compile the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   After building, you can run the tests using:
   ```bash
   ctest
   ```

## Usage
After building the project, you can run the application from the `build` directory. The specific usage instructions will depend on the functionality implemented in the source files.
